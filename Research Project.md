# Research Project (How to Reduce Vulnerabilities In Software During Development)

## Introduction
A detrimental part of creating any software, is making sure it's secure. The purpose of this questionaire was to gather data regarding the understanding of software vulnerabilities. My audience consisted of students within our campus at 'West Herts'. I selected students studying computing in various forms, this gave me a diverse range, and better chance of gaining the information i desired.

## Methods Used to Gather Information
Quantitive and qualitive methods were used, while gathering the required data. I have undergone two case studies on the subject of 'Software Vulnerabilities'. These case studies will contribute as my qualitive research. I have also created a questionaire, of which their are 20 copies. I plan to distribute said copies to various students, that study computing, or a related subject.

## Case Study 1 (Sony Playstation Network Hack)
**What Happened**
In 2011, Sony's 'Playstation Network' was attacked by hackers, compromising 77 million accounts. The unknown hackers were then able to steal over 23,400 user's account details. This was a huge blow for the giant 'Sony', costing them over a $171 million, and countless lawsuits.

**Preventative Measures**
To prevent something like this happening you would need to constantantly assess potential risks, and try to guard against them. With a company as large as 'Sony', strong encryption is integral. Updating encryptions regularly will make attacks of this scale less likely. 


## Case Study 2 (NSA Leak by Edward Snowden)
**What Happened**
Edward Snowden previously worked for the NSA. Based in Hawaii, Snowden worked as an IT subcontractor. Snowden had access to a large number of sensitive documents over his time there. What the NSA hadn't expected was that their trusted employee had been copying secret documents. These documents collectively held a worth of $1.7 million. Snowden released the various documents to the press unveiling the secret activity of the NSA. This was a massive blow to the agency, given their reputation. 

**Preventative Measures**
A way of combating this kind of activity would be to employ 'User Action Monitoring' software. This software allows you to record peoples activity. This would include: URL's typed, windows opened, files copied, ect. This would act as a deterrent, and also potentially evidence.

## Primary Research
**My end goal for this survey is to answer the following questions:**



**Are students aware of the subject of Software Vulnerabilities?**



**Does students knowledge of the subject effect their security??**

## Conclusion
My research i came to an expected conclusion, that people who practise good security, personally, have a much greater understanding of software vulnerabilities.
